# CS188-Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
Completed assignment projects in Python for UC Berkeley's CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/

## proj1-search-python3
### Project 1 - Search
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project1.html
Implemented various search methods (Depth first search, Breadth first search, A* Search ,etc) for Pacman agent to find paths through mazes to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Besides the implementation of various search method, I've also learnt more about class inheritance in Python.

## multiagent
### Project 2 - Games
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project2.html
In this project, I've designed both Pacman and ghosts agents using minimax and expectimax search. It also involved the design of an evaluation function to evaluate game states. My first time to try out simple feature engineering. A bit challenging as I've to experiment various weight vectors by tried and error to find out which works best.

## reinforcement
### Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project3.html
The first machine learning project that I did for this course. I've implemented functions for value iteration and policy evaluations for Markov's Decision Processes.
The most interesting part lies in the implementation of Q-Learning for a Pacman agent, training and finally field testing it on the game.

## ghostbusters
### Project 4 - Ghostbusters
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project4.html
A relatively more straight forward project compared to the rest.
